# HemnetHound

Stop guessing what sold for what. **HemnetHound** scrapes every sold listing you care about straight from [Hemnet](https://www.hemnet.se) and drops it into an interactive dashboard — so you can filter, compare, and download real Swedish property data in minutes, not hours.

## Overview

HemnetHound is a two-part tool built for anyone who wants a data-driven look at the Swedish real estate market:

1. **Crawler** — uses Selenium to load JavaScript-rendered Hemnet result pages and BeautifulSoup to extract structured listing data (price, size, area, monthly fee, and more).
2. **Dashboard** — a Streamlit app where you can kick off new scrape runs, explore the collected listings with live filters, and export everything as a CSV — no code required.

Whether you're tracking a neighbourhood, researching before a purchase, or just curious about the market, HemnetHound gives you the raw numbers without the manual copy-pasting.

## Features

- Crawl sold real estate listings from Hemnet using **Selenium + Chrome**
- Extract structured listing data: name, area, sold date, final price, price change %, size (m²), rooms, monthly fee, and price per m²
- Interactive **Streamlit** dashboard with two pages:
  - **📊 Data** — browse, filter, and download scraped listings as CSV
  - **🕷️ Scrape** — download fresh HTML pages and export to CSV, all from the UI
- Fast dependency management using **uv**

## Usage

### Streamlit Dashboard (recommended)

Launch the interactive app:

```sh
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

Then open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

**Step 1 — Scrape page (🕷️)**  
Choose the number of Hemnet result pages to download (1–50) and click **Start downloading**. The raw HTML is saved to the `soups/` folder.

**Step 2 — Scrape page (🕷️)**  
Click **Export to CSV** to parse all downloaded HTML files and write the results to `hemnet_data.csv`.

**Data page (📊)**  
Browse the collected listings with sidebar filters (area, price range, free-text search), view summary metrics, and download the filtered data as CSV.

### CLI

Run the crawler from the terminal without the UI:

```sh
python main.py
```
